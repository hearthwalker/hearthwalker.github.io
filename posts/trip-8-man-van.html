  <p>Ohio Trip #8 to Independence Dam State Park is in the books—a weekend that was equal parts adventure and heartwarming dad duty.</p>

<p>I clocked over 1,600 miles on the open road in the new-to-me 2018 Grand Caravan—a roadworthy beast of a man-van that hauled me (and way too much camping gear) through every twist and turn between Nebraska and Ohio and back again. Even with 28 hours of windshield time that made my aging bones quietly protest, every mile proved worth it when I saw those smiles and felt the excitement of these incredible kids. Their joy transformed the long drive into another cherished chapter of our adventure—a moving reminder that the journey is, as always, just as meaningful as the destination.</p>

<p>We geared up in true camp style for what we thought would be absolutely terrible weather—rain gear, extra tarps, blankets in the van, every guyline cinched tight and anxious glances at the sky. Yet as fate would have it, the heavy storms split around us, blessing our weekend with dry, perfect conditions. It felt as if nature itself conspired to give us a fairy-tale adventure under cloudy but rain-free skies, wrapping our camp in a gentle embrace when we needed it most.</p>

<p>Hilarity was never in short supply. Xander and Dawson took on the challenge of using the axe to split wood with wild enthusiasm, transforming almost every campfire log into paper-thin shreds—a comedy of errors that had us laughing until our sides ached. Meanwhile, Rory and Khai found pure joy in their hammock acrobatics, swinging nonstop and even squabbling over whose turn it was to swing. And then there was Xander, so utterly exhausted from the day’s escapades that he crashed right in front of the tent door—earning himself a 2 a.m. playful (and mildly painful) kick in the head that’s as funny as it is tender. Even a local raccoon, cheeky as ever, stole our trash bag—a mischievous reminder that in the wild, adventure always finds a way.</p>

<p>A heartfelt shout-out goes to Joel for gas and grocery support, Austin for gifting us the lifesaving tent AC/heater unit that ensured our nights were as cozy as they were comfortable, to the Applied crew for helping out with epic levels of camp snacks for the kiddos, and to Scott for loaning us the two big power stations that kept our little corner of paradise alive and buzzing.</p>

<p>Their selfless kindness added an extra dose of warmth to a trip already brimming with unforgettable moments. Every piece of essential gear lent, every bit of advice shared, and every unexpected thoughtful gesture has elevated these wild adventures into memories I cherish more than words can say.</p>

<p>But more than the laughs, the spilled coffee, even more than the heartwarming lantern-lit glow of a well-heated tent full of tired, well-fed kiddos on a chilly night, it’s the quiet moments that linger long after the trip is done. Every misadventure, every shared smile, and even the tiny inconveniences wove themselves into a vibrant tapestry of memories that we will carry with us long after the campfire embers have cooled. Watching these kids—every burst of laughter, each sleepy yawn at dawn, and every look of pure wonder at a sunrise—reminds me that these moments are fleeting, delicate treasures. I love these kids more than words can say. In the gentle hush of the early morning, as I watch them embrace the new day with raw, unfiltered joy, I am reminded that being a dad isn’t just about guiding and teaching—it’s about being present for these heart-stopping moments that make every bump in the road and every long, tired mile indescribably worthwhile.</p>

<p>Here’s to more unforgettable trips, endless laughter, and more moments of silent gratitude for a life filled with love, adventure, and the unparalleled joy of time spent with my favorite people.</p>
