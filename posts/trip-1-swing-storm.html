  <p>Borrowed pickup, rented U-Haul, heart in my throat. That was the convoy that carried me east in the fall of 2022—the first time I’d seen the kids since the divorce papers turned home into separate ZIP codes. Their mom’s moving van had overflowed, so I volunteered for the leftovers run. The load was so random it felt like a garage-sale Tetris, but the pièce de résistance was a massive wooden porch swing I ratchet-strapped into the pickup bed like a stubborn ark. Eight hundred miles of cornfields and county roads later, I looked in my rear-view mirror and kept wondering which of us—the swing or me—was actually being hauled across state lines to start over.</p>

  <h3>Rain on Repeat</h3>
  <p>Our rendezvous point was a pocket-sized state park in Indiana that promised lake views and starry skies. It delivered neither. The rain set in before the tailgate thudded open and never truly left. By the time I realized the camp stove was missing its fuel-line fitting, the kids were already eyeing the clouds like, <em>Nice one, Dad.</em></p>
  <p>Enter the emergency solid-fuel stove: a folding metal square I’d tossed into the kit at the last minute. It’s more “lifeboat ration” than culinary wizard, but hype and hunger make excellent seasoning. We perched under the tailgate, cooking food over little blue flames while thunder rolled through the hardwoods. The kids swore it tasted better than my usual camp cooking (lies—but comforting ones).</p>

  <h3>Three-Person Tent, Five Hearts</h3>
  <p>Night turned everything slick and silver. The moment we zipped the fly on my trusty Alps Mountaineering Chaos 3, the sky really uncorked. Five people in a three-person tent sounds like a clown-car gag until you’re doing it for real—then it’s a comic miracle. The littlest curled into the footbox, the middle two sprawled sideways like puppies, and my oldest balanced a phone on a stuff sack so we could stream a downloaded cartoon. I lay there between sleeping bags, listening to synchronized rain-drum and kid-giggles. My shoulders finally unclenched around 1 a.m., and I thought: <em>If this is all we get, it’s still everything.</em></p>

  <h3>Swinging Back</h3>
  <p>Morning smelled of damp pine and half-burned tablet fuel. We brewed instant cocoa in my camping mug and passed it around while the kids argued about who got the porch swing first back in Ohio. Loading up felt lighter than unloading, even in the drizzle—maybe because the truck no longer carried just furniture, but new memories strapped in alongside.</p>
  <p>I hugged them outside their mom’s house, that swing looming over us like proof I’d shown up. It wasn’t enough time and never will be, and the drive back west felt raw. Somewhere on that sodden Indiana weekend, visitation quietly became adventure.</p>

  <h3>Takeaways for the Next Run</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Don’t trust the gear list in your head. <strong>Check the stove (twice).</strong></li>
    <li>Solid-fuel tablets are clutch—but pack extra snacks that don’t require heat, just in case.</li>
    <li>A tarp over the tent is non-negotiable when the forecast is sketchy.</li>
    <li>Download a movie or two; cell service at back-country parks is wishful thinking.</li>
    <li>Over-secure everything on the trailer. Bumpy county roads are merciless on improvised cargo.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Looking back, the weekend flickers in my memory like campfire sparks—bright, brief, a little smoky. It hurt, yes. But hurt can share space with joy when you let it. And joy, like that oversized porch swing, has a habit of tagging along for the ride.</p>
