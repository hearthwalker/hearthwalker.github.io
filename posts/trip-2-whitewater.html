  <p>Four days, 1,865 mostly-drama-free miles, and one freshly christened Ford Excursion that now smells like wet socks, camp smoke, and victorious kids’ laughter—exactly how a summer run to see your babies should smell. We pointed the big V10 east at dawn, coffee steaming in the cupholders, Austin riding shotgun with a playlist that swung from 90s grunge to guilty-pleasure country. Four hundred miles in, Austin decided that now was the perfect moment to plug in the coil on cylinder #10. The truck coughed once, sighed like it had finally found its lungs, and the second half of the outbound haul felt downright civilized—if the long interstate stretches of Midwest humidity can ever be called that.</p>

  <p>Whitewater Memorial State Park greeted us with a wall of green so thick it swallowed the horizon. Hoosier air is heavy; it clings to you like a damp blanket. By late afternoon the sky bruised purple, then split wide open. We rigged a tarp down to the Excursion’s tow hooks and huddled underneath while the storm pounded around us—thunder in our ribs, rain ricocheting off the hood, kids squealing every time lightning cracked. Nothing like a Midwest squall to remind you you’re alive. When it finally broke, the forest dripped and steamed like a sauna, and everything—gear, clothes, souls—stayed stubbornly damp.</p>

  <p>Night two was survival mode. The tent felt twelve degrees hotter than the outside air (how does that even happen?), and I remember half-crawling out onto the gravel, staring at the stars, bargaining with the universe for a breeze—or at least the spare cash for another motel room. But the kids were asleep, the Excursion was solid, and we made it until dawn with only minor existential dread and an impressive constellation of mosquito bites.</p>

  <p>By night three, morale was somewhere south of comfortable, so we gave in: cheap hotel, blessed air-conditioning, Taco Bell feast sprawled across the bedsheets, and showers long enough to steam up an industrial mirror. Funny how a packet of Fire Sauce and genuinely clean hair can reset an entire family’s mood. For a moment, we were just a goofy road-trip crew again—no storm trauma, no heat index, just giggles echoing down the hallway.</p>

  <p>The ride back west was brutal in that quiet way only good-bye miles can be. Dropping the kids off—second time doing it—felt like handing over pieces of my chest. The Excursion felt cavernous without their chatter, every roadside billboard a taunt. Nebraska’s wide-open spaces finally swallowed us up, and the trip wound down not with fireworks but with the steady hum of tires and the bittersweet knowing that the hard part of loving from a distance is always the drive home.</p>
