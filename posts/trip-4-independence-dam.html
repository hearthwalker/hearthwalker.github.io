  <p>Trip #4 to Independence Dam State Park, Ohio is a wrap! Made some most excellent memories in northwest Ohio.</p>

  <p>The weather was perfect, the s'mores were only slightly rained on, and as of 6 p.m. today the tent and camp chairs are finally dried out. Had a blast with these amazing kids and can't wait for Trip #5 in July!</p>

  <p>We set up camp along the Maumee River. Sunny skies all day, with one cheeky sprinkle that dared to mist our s’mores. The kids roasted marshmallows like pros, argued technique, and laughed through sticky fingers and slightly charred grahams.</p>

  <p>Packing up meant hauling home a damp tent and chairs—sun-drying them in the backyard became part of the ritual. By dinner everything was crisp again, and it felt like a small but deeply satisfying victory.</p>

  <p>Moments that linger: river walks, a late-night phone-movie huddle in the tent, waking to birdsong instead of alarms. The things you don’t always remember sharply, yet feel in your bones afterward.</p>

  <p>These kids… resilient, hilarious, full of heart. Every run layers new memories onto the life we’re shaping together—still full of wonder, still muddy, still crackling with campfire chatter.</p>

  <p>Trip #5 is on deck for July—already counting the days.</p>
