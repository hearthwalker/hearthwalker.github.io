  <p>Michigan Trip #9 – June 2025</p>


  <p>This trip wasn’t just a getaway. It was a pilgrimage. Four kids. One van. Roughly 1,600 miles of highways, rest stops, toll booths, thunderstorms, and slow sips of root beer beneath pine branches. It was loud and quiet, chaotic and still, exhausting and mellow.</p>

  <h2>The Prep</h2>
  <p>This trip didn’t begin with the turn of a key. It began in the quiet tension of preparation—the kind of labor that whispers before it roars.</p>
  <p>Long before Hearthwalker rolled east, I was already moving—trading on-call weeks for a Yakima Skybox, selling old tech to fund new memories. One of the phones I turned into an EcoATM machine held every photo from the stormy years, 2020 through 2022. I backed it up just in time, said a quiet goodbye, and watched another tether to the past slip free.</p>
  <p>Got Hearthwalker her oil changed with 237,000 miles under her belt and a prayer in my throat. She’s carried so much more than gear. Packing wasn’t a checklist—it was a pilgrimage of its own.</p>
  <p>Rolled an hour away to stock the van with groceries and as luck would have it, the storm broke loose. Grocery bags ripped under the weight of rain and Caprisun boxes. I stood soaked in the Walmart parking lot throwing bags of food into the van. But I got what we needed: food, drinks, seasonings and comforts. That final night in Albion, thunder rolled over the plains while I parked at the shop, soaked to the bone, packing and repacking the van.</p>
  <p>Every shift of a power station, every duffel bag rotated and zipped, was about more than space—it was about place. Four kids were counting on that interior to hold them all the way from Ohio to the Michigan campsite, and I was damn well going to make it fit. I sweat buckets in the humid Nebraska air but managed to win the game of Tetris and got everything just-so. By the time the fridges were loaded, humming beside the power stations and tucked between a coil of fairy lights and a dream or two, it was clear: this trip wasn’t a vacation. It was a campaign of love, waged with stubborn grace and carried on the back of an old van and a dad who refused to let the storm win.</p>

  <h2>The Journey</h2>
  <p>This was the longest trip yet—four full days instead of the usual whirlwind. Most visits are heartbreakingly brief: I typically leave Nebraska Thursday night, drive 800 miles to pick them up, and we get one full day—Saturday—before it’s time to pack up camp and drive them home Sunday morning. It’s a blur. A race against the clock. A weekend warrior’s offering to the gods of distance and custody schedules.</p>
  <p>But this time? We got to exhale. Five days. Real mornings. Slow coffee. Campfire nights that didn’t feel stolen, but given. Time to sit in the shade and just… be, without already watching the clock.</p>
  <p>Xander noticed. “You seem… weirdly chill,” he said, with that teenage eyebrow raise that lands somewhere between compliment and concern. I smiled. Because he was right.</p>
  <p>And in that moment, I realized: this was what I’d been chasing. Not just more time—but better time. Time where I wasn’t spending the weekend recovering from the long drive. Time where they didn’t have to compete with my exhaustion. Time where I wasn’t just there in body, but in spirit, too. Because my kids don’t just deserve to be seen. They deserve to be seen by a dad who’s fully there.</p>
  <p>The drive was brutal in that way only long hauls fueled by purpose can be. About 800 miles each way, and I felt every one of them. I left work Tuesday evening after work and didn’t bother trying to nap beforehand. Just climbed into Hearthwalker with a fridge full of water and energy drinks in the passenger seat, a stack of music queued up on Spotify, and the ghost of exhaustion already riding shotgun.</p>
  <p>I knew I wouldn’t make it all the way that night, so I pushed until the weariness outweighed the will. Pulled into a rest area somewhere past the halfway point in eastern Iowa, reclined my seat and slept like only a tired dad can—shoes still on, fan keeping the stuffy heat at bay, half-listening for anything that might go wrong. I didn’t want to idle the van because gas isn’t cheap and 237k miles makes a man listen to every rattle.</p>
  <p>I woke before sunrise, my legs cramped but my resolve intact, and pushed east again. As I rolled into Indiana, the skies opened up. A squall line slammed through and I found myself holed up at a toll road oasis, watching sheets of rain batter the parking lot while semi trailers groaned and swayed in the wind. It was miserable and somehow... perfect. That kind of moment when you realize you’re already inside the story. A quick text to the kids’ mom revealed that the four kiddos were moving like molasses anyway, so the delay didn’t bother me too much.</p>
  <p>Eventually, the storm passed and I rolled into Ohio, the weight of the drive still sitting heavy on my shoulders. Then the door opened, and four kids came spilling out like sunlight, grins on their faces and running to me for dad hugs. That’s the moment it always clicks—the reason for the road, the reason for everything.</p>

  <h2>Lake Hudson: A New Home Base</h2>
  <p>We’ve camped all over, but Lake Hudson in Michigan hit different. According to the kiddos, it’s now our new home base. The site was roomy, kinda-sorta shaded, and just wild enough. The kids were immediately in their element, setting up a shelter just in time for an epic storm to blow through.</p>
  <p>The heat that first day wasn’t just hot — it was personal. The kind of thick, breath-stealing humidity that makes you question every fabric choice and life decision that led you to spending four days in a tent in the woods. The EcoFlow AC unit did its best, pumping out glorious cold air while filling gallon jugs with condensation like it was trying to hydrate the entire forest. By midday, the sleeping bags were starting to feel more like steamed dumplings.</p>
  <p>We held off setting up the tent until after the storm passed — no sense fighting rain and poles in that kind of soup. Instead, we adapted. I made a quick Dollar General run and returned with a $10 fan, some Prime drinks, and a stack of coloring books. That fan? It might’ve looked like cheap plastic, but it worked like a relic blessed by Odin himself. Totally earned its place in the camp hall of fame.</p>
  <p>Rory and Khai parked themselves in the red camp chairs like two pint-sized monarchs surveying their woodland domain. Xander? He was out cold under a tarp, horizontal from exhaustion, looking like a teenage casualty of adventure. The heat tried its best to win, but we had fans, shade, and stubborn joy on our side.</p>
  <p>The tent lit up with lantern glow each night. Olaf, the AC unit, turned our tent into a cool, dry sanctuary. We had quiet mornings, slow starts, and zero pressure.</p>

<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Marshmallow Monk:</strong> Khai approached s’more construction like a culinary ceremony. He didn’t just roast marshmallows—he meditated over them. Golden brown perfection or blackened, nothing in between. No rush. He slowly rotated his skewer like a seasoned grill master performing a sacred rite. And when he finally assembled his s’more, he held it up and admired it like it might ascend. That marshmallow didn’t just stretch. It spoke.</li>
  <li><strong>Root Beer Royalty:</strong> Rory spent this trip with the comfortable swagger of someone who’s camped a hundred times before. She parked herself in her red chair with a Prime drink or root beer in hand, draped in campfire glow and rainbow leggings, and ruled the forest with casual flair. She collected flowers and magic sticks and returned from the woods like a queen returning from a successful meetup with the fae.</li>
  <li><strong>Wood Splitting Warriors:</strong> With wide stances and serious faces, Xander and Dawson took to the logs like vikings preparing for winter. Their technique was shockingly solid—none of that “dad yelling from the sidelines” needed. There’s something about a teen raising an axe and landing it clean that settles into a dad’s chest. It was power, precision, and pride all in one. That pile of firewood wasn’t just fuel. It was proof of their skill and hard work.</li>
  <li><strong>The Raccoon Sentinel:</strong> Late one night, as the rest of us were drifting off to the hum of the AC and the quiet tones of a sleep playlist, just as the fire burned low and the air was finally cooling, a new visitor arrived—a plump raccoon sniffing around the camp like it owned the place. Xander, vibing by the fire, was on his feet instantly. With the speed of a sentry and the command of someone who knew the stakes, he grabbed a flashlight and marched straight toward it. No yelling. Just firm steps and steely presence. The raccoon took one look at Xander’s “I’m not playing” energy and bolted into the woods. Xander went back to the fire without a word, sat down, and resumed his evening like defending the perimeter was just part of his vibe. Legendary.</li>
  <li><strong>The Great Bird Rescue:</strong> On that same night, after chasing off the raccoon, Xander noticed the owl. Big, bold, and entirely uninterested in hiding—much more interested in eating the baby robin on the ground. What followed was an impromptu rescue operation with the neighbor kids enlisted like a ragtag wildlife SWAT team. Under the glow of string lights and a dying fire, they caught the baby bird, kept it safe from the giant owl lurking in the trees, then ultimately placed it into a cardboard box inside a nearby tent. A water cap. A few twigs. A team of kid guardians standing watch in shifts. It was pure heart. In the morning, as the neighbors pulled out of their campsite to leave, we got the good news that the bird had survived the night and was released to go do bird things.</li>
  <li><strong>Steak Tacos by Firelight:</strong> One warm evening we slow-cooked steak on the griddle with white onions and a cilantro-lime sauce that could make a poet cry. The tortillas toasted just right—soft edges, warm centers. When one of the boys leaned back and said, “This is my favorite camp night ever,” I didn’t doubt him for a second. That fire ring might as well have been a five-star restaurant.</li>
  <li><strong>The Mustard Incident:</strong> It began with generosity—Dawson cooking a snacky brat for Xander on the twig stove. But when Xander didn’t feel like getting up from his comfortable chair to retrieve it, diplomacy failed and an argument ensued. In retaliation, Xander launched a line of honey mustard from across the site, splattering Dawson’s clean shirt and shorts. There was a pause, the kind you feel in your chest more than your ears. Then movement. Voices raised just a little. But somehow… no blowout. Just paper towels, a few laughs, and the kind of story I’m sure they’ll tell each other years from now when they camp with their own kids.</li>
  <li><strong>The Flower Offering:</strong> Rory came back from one of her solo explorations holding what could only be described as a nature talisman—a fistful of forest treasures. Flowers, berries, and a small crooked stick that looked suspiciously magical. She arranged them on the table like an altar. It wasn’t a game. It was reverence. When she was done, she sat in her camp chair and sipped her root beer with the serene smile of someone who knows the forest listens.</li>
  <li><strong>The Coloring Book War Council:</strong> At the peak of the heat, the picnic table under the shelter transformed into a strategic command post. Crayons, red pens, worksheets, and Prime drinks laid across the table like battle gear. Rory dove in like a focused artist on a deadline. Khai flipped pages and squinted with a scholar’s intensity. It was hot, chaotic, and borderline feral—and yet, peaceful. No one fought. No one wandered. They created.</li>
  <li><strong>Lantern Light Laughter:</strong> When the fire dimmed and the stars came out, the tent became our chapel. Lantern glow casting gold on their cheeks, blankets tangled, jokes whispered. It was the kind of laughter that lives in the pauses—the “remember when” kind that seeds memories deep. I lay there those nights pretending to scroll, just to listen. Because someday, I’ll want to remember how they sounded when they were safe and soft and young.</li>
  <li><strong>Synthwave &amp; Stillness:</strong> It hit me mid-afternoon one day—the sense that everything was okay. The older boys on their phones, the little ones exploring vacant campsites around our own, and me, sitting with “The Midnight” playing softly while I journaled. The air was soft. The tent was cool. And there was nothing urgent. No one needed me in that moment, and that was the gift. A moment to just be.</li>
</ul>


  <h2>The Soundtrack</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Outro – M83:</strong> The night drive anthem</li>
    <li><strong>Interstate Love Song – Stone Temple Pilots:</strong> Played loud, the fire blazing bright while cooking steak tacos</li>
    <li><strong>Airplane Bottle – Robyn Ottolini:</strong> The kids’ favorite song to play on repeat</li>
    <li><strong>Once in a Lifetime – The Invention of Flight:</strong> The kids drifting off to sleep, stars overhead glowing with the string lights</li>
    <li><strong>Saturn – Sleeping At Last:</strong> The moment when everything softened post-trip</li>
    <li><strong>Damocles – Sleep Token:</strong> Photo editing and writing session after returning home and feeling every mile in my chest</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Return</h2>
  <p>We packed up slowly in 90 degree heat. No rush. The gear piled up by the van like armor shed after battle. The heat was still oppressive, but the mood stayed light. We drove the hour back to Ohio, the kids fighting sleep but everyone enjoying the van’s skookum air conditioning. I dropped the kids off with hugs, then headed to South Bend for lasagna with family.</p>
  <p>That night I made it to a rest area in Iowa. Slept hard. Woke early. Took a quiet walk through the trees. The light was soft. The air was kind. The trip concluded in quiet, uneventful miles through Iowa and back into Nebraska.</p>
  <p>I sat still for a moment in the hush after shutting down the tired van and thought: I did it. We did it.</p>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>This wasn’t the flashiest trip. There were no dramatic hikes, no epic waterfalls. But it may have been the most important.</p>
  <p>The magic wasn’t in the itinerary. It was in the tiny things: a cool fan. A shared drink. A marshmallow pulled slowly from the fire. The way Rory curled up in her chair and Khai walked the woods like a storybook child. The way Xander relaxed under a tarp and Dawson took over espresso production like a seasoned barista.</p>
  <p>I didn’t make them unplug. I didn’t force perfection. I just held the line. I showed up. And I gave them a space to be little, to be safe, to be loved.</p>
  <p>To the ones who supported this trip, thank you. Scott, for the borrowed gear and the Yakima. ACT, for the flexibility. And to anyone who's been quietly rooting for me, this trip is your proof that it’s all working.</p>

  <p><strong>Let there be love.<br/>
  Let there be woods.<br/>
  Let there be dads who show up, even when the road is long.</strong></p>
