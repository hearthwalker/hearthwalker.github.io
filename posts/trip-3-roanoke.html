  <p>Trip #3 to Ohio went off without a hitch! Changed it up a little this time and went with an AirBNB instead of a tent—the kids appreciated the wi-fi and running water. Less appreciated was their dad tormenting them with gen-z slang..</p>

  <h3>Trading Nylon for Drywall</h3>
  <p>Trading nylon walls for drywall was the move. The kids and I posted up in a roomy AirBNB on the edge of Roanoke where the April grass was greening fast enough to squeak under your shoes. A massive backyard—complete with creaky old swing set—meant every lull in screen time turned into barefoot sprints and improvised tag tournaments.</p>

  <h3>Comfort Level: Legendary</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Beds:</strong> Pillow-top, cloud-soft, and allegedly “better than Mom’s couch,” according to Rowan.</li>
    <li><strong>Wi-Fi:</strong> Fiber so quick the speed test broke triple digits. Even Xander, a notorious latency snob, had zero notes.</li>
    <li><strong>Running water:</strong> Endless hot showers = no more campground coin-op roulette.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Aunt Maire Came Through</h3>
  <p>Saturday, Maire cruised in for the afternoon. We caught up on the porch while the kids roamed the yard, and we somehow squeezed five rounds of “tell-me-everything” into two hours. Sunshine, sibling laughs, and freshly cut grass—you could bottle that vibe as antidepressant.</p>

  <h3>Xander’s CoD Lab</h3>
  <p>Inside, Xander went full mad-scientist on the gaming laptop, tuning “the perfect” Call of Duty loadout. Every fifteen minutes he emerged to announce a new recoil pattern breakthrough, then vanished again into the digital war zone. Proud Dad moment? Absolutely—though I’ll still get smoked next match.</p>

  <h3>Plex Envy Is Real</h3>
  <p>Look, I’m smug about my own Plex server … but this AirBNB host? They had a catalog that straight-up humbled me: vintage anime, remastered deep-cut sci-fi, Criterion classics I’ve been hunting for ages. I bowed in silent respect—then mentally budgeted for a few more hard drives.</p>

  <h3>Food Highlights</h3>
  <p><em>Local pizza that slapped:</em> The Patio Pizza & BBQ on High Street—crispy-edge thin crust, smoked wings, ranch that could start wars.</p>
  <p><em>Epic breakfasts:</em> Dad’s skillet hash (hash browns, farm-stand eggs, THICK bacon). When the syrup bottle ran empty, the kids scraped the last drops with forks—call that a five-star review.</p>

  <h3>Dad-Level Cringe, Updated</h3>
  <p>With creature comforts handled, I leaned into my true role: tormentor-via-slang. Phrases like “That pizza, low-key bussin’, no cap” and “Y’all vibin’ or nah?” echoed through the halls. Groans achieved a perfect chorus. Goal met.</p>

  <h3>Wrap-Up</h3>
  <p>No tent poles bent, no rainfly sagged, no one melting down at 3 a.m.—just warm beds, fast internet, and backyard laughter I’ll replay on the hard drives of the heart. The kids rated the trip “9.7/10—minus 0.3 for Dad’s vocabulary.” I can live with that.</p>
